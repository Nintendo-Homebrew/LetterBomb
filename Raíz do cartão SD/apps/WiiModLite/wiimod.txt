DisableSetAHBPROT=0

; DeleteDefaultInsteadRemove : Change delete ios method when higher version is found during install

; skipios : Sometimes loading an ios will error or leave the app(nandemu) which
; is a problem for check ios, so this option allows you to blacklist IOS numbers
; so that they aren't loaded during check ios. You can also have more than one set
; so for example
;skipios=253
;skipios=254
; these two would skip checking sorg's nandemu and bootmii. Note: the app already skips these two
; IOSs so you shouldn't enable these examples.

; skiphash : This option is similar to skipios but instead of blacklisting a number like 254,
; this option blacklists a particular hash. You can get hashes of IOSs by disabling the checking
; IOS and enabling dump hash on the check IOS menu. You can also have more than one set.
; so for example
;skiphash=58c5d8b1,ccaa035b,14d3e159,3209c037,a915552a
;skiphash=8e669eb1,f72a1f6f,36b19cc6,1743a3f,c860f5cb
; these two would skip checking sorg's nandemu and bootmii. Note: the app already skips these two
; IOSs so you shouldn't enable these examples.
